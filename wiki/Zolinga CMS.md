# Zolinga CMS

## Introduction

Zolinga CMS is a database-less content management system that is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend.

Features:

- No database required
- Uses familiar static-HTML file structure
- Support for auto-generated menu
- Support for expanding dynamic custom elements. E.g. `<cms-menu depth="2"></cms-menu>`
- Support for translating content ([Zolinga Intl](https://github.com/webdevelopers-eu/zolinga-intl) module required)
- Support for templates
- And much more...

## But... why?

It is a hybrid between a plain static HTML files and a fullblown database-driven CMS. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. Able to support simplified page templates and dynamic elements.

The use cases are endless. You can use it for a simple blog, a small different-design microsites that have content updated
using FTP, a personal site with custom contact form written in PHP...

Really endless. It is up to you. I just provide the shovel. You find the gold.
